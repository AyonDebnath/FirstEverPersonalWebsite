# Welcome to My First Website Project!

This is the first website I ever built! It's a fun project that I'm excited to share with you all.

Fun Fact: This was the first website I built in my high-school before learning any programming languages / Frameworks. I later decided to upload the project to GitHub.

P.S. The website is no longer being updated.

## Getting Started

To explore the site, you have two options:

**1. Preview Online:**
- Visit https://ayon13.netlify.app/ to get an instant preview of the site.

**2. Clone the Repository:**
- Simply clone this repository and run the `index.html` file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AyonDebnath/FirstWebsite-HTML-CSS.git
```
```bash
cd FirstWebsite-HTML-CSS
```
Run `index.html` in your browser



## What to Expect
This website is a culmination of my HTML/CSS skills. Feel free to navigate around, click on elements, and enjoy the overall experience.
